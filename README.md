This is a python project for recommendation system for the books the user may want to read based on his rating on the previous books he read and also with the possiblity to recommend based on the favourite author.
I use the GOODREADS dataset in my project.

Another project already exists with another dataset from IMDB with different name to recommend the next movies the user may want to see and also with the possiblity to recommend based on the favourite director.
